Any financial integration is to be avoided as is the gathering of personal information. Prior to being recast as Globe&Citizen, the company will complete work on an anonymizing HTTP reverse proxy called, \"Layer8.\" This anonymizing reverse proxy will have the sole purpose of removing from user requests all identifying information. This will allow Globe&Citizen to reflect usage statistics publicly without any possibility of leaking personal information -- this is absolutely fundamental to success.",
